# TechConnect

TechConnect is boiler-plate code for a web merchandise store using PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL.

It features dynamically generated webpages based on the MySQL database and displays the current selection and quantity that each customer is able to purchase, and as well includes a refund page which both automatically updates the MySQL database.

The items are sorted by Brand and Category, and then are sorted alphabetically with drop-down lists for the user to use. As well, there is a search function that allows the user to search products quickly.

In order to test this code for yourself, install Xampp, place the TechConnect folder in xampp\htdocs, then launch Apache and MySQL on the Xampp control panel. With your preferred web browser, type in 'localhost/TechConnect/manager.php in order to initalize the MySQL database from data.csv in xampp\htdocs. It will prompt you when the database is correctly initalized and then, you can proceed to the site with 'localhost/TechConnect/index.php
